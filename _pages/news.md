- I defended my Ph.D. thesis on "Aerial Vehicle Tracking using a Multi-modal Optical Sensor" as of May 16, 2016. I would like to thank my thesis committee, my advisor Dr. Hoffman and co-adviser Dr. Vodacek for their supervision throughout my Ph.D. [Presentation](../files/Thesis.Defense.pdf)

- I finished my internship at *Huawei R&D* where I worked on representing people with face-only and contextual features to classify individuals in a photo album as strangers and family members. The second part of my work included designing an album-specific classifier to assign sematic roles to family members. My work also includes designing a general conditional random field graph based approach where several attributes about the individuals, and pairs are utilized to assign semantic roles. You can find an experiment on a family picture with strangers in the figure below. To learn contextual features, the ZFNet (Improved AlexNet) is fine-tuned on the People in Photo Album Dataset on three different areas including context. You can find the Caffe fine-tuning prototxt files in this [link](https://github.com/uzkent/AlexNet_FineTuned_PersonRecognition). For the face-only area, the pre-trained *FaceNet* model, an end-to-end face verification model, is used.
